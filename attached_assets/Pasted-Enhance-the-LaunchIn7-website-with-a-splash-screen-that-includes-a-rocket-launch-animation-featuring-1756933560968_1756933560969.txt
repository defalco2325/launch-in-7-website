Enhance the LaunchIn7 website with a splash screen that includes a rocket launch animation featuring a smoke trail and rocket exhaust effects integrated with the LaunchIn7 logo.

Splash Screen

Full-screen white overlay.

Centered LaunchIn7 logo; keep the “i” and “n” in black and the blue site gradient on the ‘7’.

Tagline under logo: “Launch Your Business in 7 Days.”

Soft outer glow on the ‘7’ for a futuristic, on-brand feel.

Rocket & Effects

Treat the bottom of the “7” as the rocket nozzle (or use the rocket inside the 7 if available).

Smoke trail: billowing, semi-transparent smoke that expands and fades as the splash “launches” away. Use Framer Motion keyframes + CSS blur; optionally layer an SVG filter or a Lottie JSON smoke asset for realism.

Exhaust plume/particles: short-lived sparks and heat distortion shimmer emitted from the nozzle. Small circular particles with additive blend/low opacity that quickly fade and drift.

Subtle blue-white glow pulses in sync with the exhaust for 0.8–1.2s before lift-off.

Animation Sequence

On load (0–800ms): Logo fades in and gently scales 1.0 → 1.03 (breath/pulse).

Ignition (800–1400ms): Exhaust starts (sparks + glow), smoke begins beneath the nozzle, opacity ramps up.

Launch (1400–1900ms): Splash screen accelerates upward (easeIn), leaving a trailing smoke column that quickly dissipates.

Reveal (after 1900ms): Main site underneath fades in and shifts up 8–12px (easeOut). Remove splash DOM once complete.

Tech & Impl

React + Tailwind + Framer Motion (no external CSS frameworks).

Create components: <SplashScreen />, <SmokeTrail />, <ExhaustParticles />.

Use sessionStorage (key: l7_splash_seen=true) so it shows once per full page load only.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: skip motion, use simple fade-in/out.

Keep animation buttery smooth (target 60fps), throttle particle count on low-end devices.

Ensure responsive behavior (mobile-first) and test on Safari iOS/Chrome Android.

Visual & Brand Notes

Background remains pure white; smoke uses neutral grays with low opacity and blur (avoid muddying the page).

Blue gradient on the ‘7’ should match the site’s current gradient.

Keep overall vibe professional, modern, and cutting-edge.

Acceptance Criteria

Smooth, stutter-free launch-away effect with convincing smoke and exhaust.

Main content is interactable within ~2s.

No layout shift/jump when splash is removed.

A11y: Splash has aria-hidden="true" and does not trap focus."
