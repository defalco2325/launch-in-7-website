1) LCP / Hero Optimization

“Optimize the Largest Contentful Paint: preload the hero image and main font, convert the hero image to AVIF/WebP, set explicit dimensions, avoid lazy-loading the LCP image, remove any autoplay/carousel in the hero, and delay non-essential animations until after first paint. Don’t show code—implement and report the new LCP.”

2) Main-Thread / TBT Reduction

“Reduce Total Blocking Time under 200 ms by splitting long tasks, deferring non-critical scripts, moving heavy computations to a web worker or requestIdleCallback, and memoizing heavy React subtrees. Don’t show code—apply changes and summarize the biggest wins.”

3) JS Weight & Code Splitting

“Further shrink the JavaScript footprint: confirm route-level code splitting on all major views, lazy-load rare/heavy components, replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives, and remove unused modules. Target a main entry under 180 KB gzip. Don’t show code—make the changes and list what was removed or swapped.”

4) Images, Fonts, and Caching

“Systematically optimize images (AVIF/WebP, srcset/sizes, lazy below-the-fold), self-host and subset fonts with font-display: swap, enable Brotli/gzip and long-cache immutable assets with no-cache for HTML. Don’t show code—implement and confirm reductions.”

5) Security & Best Practices (≥95)

“Force HTTPS and add security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options/SameOrigin, Referrer-Policy, basic CSP). Remove dev sourcemaps/console logs from production. Don’t show code—apply and summarize.”

6) Accessibility to ≥95

“Fix color contrast to WCAG AA across UI, ensure one H1 and correct heading hierarchy, add visible focus states, label all inputs, and ensure error/success messages are announced to screen readers. Don’t show code—apply fixes and list what changed.”

7) Re-run Lighthouse & Gate

“Run Lighthouse (mobile + desktop) three times on / and key routes. Save HTML reports to /lhci_reports, show category scores, and list top 5 remaining issues if any category <90. Don’t show code—just the results.”
