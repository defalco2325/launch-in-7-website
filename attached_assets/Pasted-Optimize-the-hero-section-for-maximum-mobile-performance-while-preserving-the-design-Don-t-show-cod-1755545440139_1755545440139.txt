Optimize the hero section for maximum mobile performance while preserving the design. Don’t show code—just implement changes and report results.

Goals
	•	Mobile LCP < 2.5s, FCP < 1.8s, TBT < 200ms, CLS < 0.1
	•	60 FPS hero animations; zero jank on scroll

Hero Scope (elements in screenshot)
	•	Background/glow panel
	•	‘const website = “launching…”’ code card
	•	‘Build Progress’ bar + ‘Day 6/7’ label
	•	‘Optimization’ tile
	•	‘Scroll to explore’ chevron
	•	Primary CTA button (blue→aqua)

Required changes
	1.	Make headline the LCP
	•	Ensure the hero headline/subhead (and CTA) render immediately.
	•	Preload one subset font (woff2) for headlines; font-display: swap.
	•	Remove text shadows/filters from LCP text.
	2.	Images (if any in hero)
	•	Convert to AVIF/WebP, keep each ≤ 60–80KB.
	•	Provide explicit width/height (or aspect-ratio).
	•	Mark only the true LCP image with fetchpriority=high. No lazy on LCP.
	3.	Background & glows
	•	Replace any blur/backdrop-filter with CSS radial-gradients on a single pseudo-element.
	•	Avoid stacked translucent layers; keep to one composited layer.
	4.	Progress bar animation
	•	Animate with transform: scaleX on a child element; add will-change: transform.
	•	Start animation only after hero is visible (IntersectionObserver + rAF).
	•	Provide prefers-reduced-motion fallback (static bar).
	5.	CTA button
	•	Keep gradient static; on hover/press animate only opacity/transform (no box-shadow growth).
	•	Ensure contrast AA+ for label over gradient.
	6.	Chevron / micro-motion
	•	Animate via opacity/transform only; pause when off-screen; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
	7.	Critical CSS & loading
	•	Inline tiny critical CSS for header + hero; load remaining CSS async.
	•	Defer analytics/3P until idle.
	•	Confirm route-level code-split keeps initial JS for / ≤ 150KB (gz/br).
	•	(If supported) Prerender / so text paints before hydration.
	8.	Main-thread hygiene
	•	Split any long tasks (>50ms) in the hero lifecycle.
	•	Memoize expensive subtrees in the hero; avoid prop chains that cause re-renders.
	•	Add contain: layout paint to decorative containers to limit repaint areas.

Accessibility (must)
	•	Single <h1> in hero; logical heading order.
	•	Visible focus ring on CTA; contrast pass on all hero text.

After changes
	•	Run Lighthouse mobile + desktop (3x) and report: LCP, FCP, TBT, CLS, and Performance/Accessibility/Best-Practices/SEO scores.
	•	Provide a short summary of what was changed and the largest time savings (ms).
	•	If Performance < 90 on mobile, list top 3 remaining blockers with proposed fixes.”
