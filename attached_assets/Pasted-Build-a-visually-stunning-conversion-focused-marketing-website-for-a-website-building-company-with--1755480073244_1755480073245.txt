Build a visually stunning, conversion-focused marketing website for a website-building company with these exact requirements:

Tech & Setup

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

UI: shadcn/ui, lucide-react icons, Framer Motion for smooth, subtle animations.

Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation. Lead forms POST to a server action or /api/lead; log submissions and include a Nodemailer transport scaffold with .env.example placeholders (no real send).

SEO: Configure next-seo, generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt, add OpenGraph/Twitter meta, and FAQ JSON-LD.

Performance: Target Lighthouse ≥95 across Performance/SEO/Best Practices/Accessibility.

Analytics: Add a simple placeholder snippet (e.g., Vercel/Umami/GA) with a TODO for the ID.

Style & Branding

Look: Apple/Stripe-inspired minimalism; premium and trustworthy with bold type and generous whitespace.

Colors (no purple):

Deep Navy #0F172A (or #111827) for authority/headers/hero backgrounds

White #FFFFFF and Light Gray #F9FAFB for clean sections

Accent gradient Electric Blue → Aqua (#2563EB → #06B6D4) for CTAs/highlights

Success Green #10B981 for guarantee badges/success states

Typography:

Headlines: Poppins or Inter (bold weights)

Body: Inter or Open Sans

Animation: Framer Motion fade-ins/slide-ups; tasteful only (no gimmicks).

Information Architecture (Pages)

/ – Landing (primary funnel)

/about – Story, values, process

/contact – Lead form + guarantee reminder

Important: Do not create or link any Pricing page. No pricing displays anywhere.
